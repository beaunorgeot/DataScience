# DataScience
Essential concepts and examples for doing/understanding data science

There are basically 2 types of files here:
1. scripts(.R) that meant as tutorials and contain very useful examples. The scripts aren't meant to be 'run', they are collections of run-able code
2. PDF docs that provide a combination of theory and examples

Scripts and PDF docs are meant to combined, used together.

I think that I break all of these topics up into categories
Dplyr
ggplot2
caret


The elements in "Most Useful" are simply a snapshot of my condensed notes w/concepts and some examples that I feel are important from my google drive. The most update versions of these will always be in my drive. They exist here as an additional backup to make sure that I don't loose my prescious.
